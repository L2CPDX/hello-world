## Coding Notes
**This repository is a dumping ground for various coding notes I've taken on different beginner / learner tutorials.**  
  
**Notes are from the following:**  
 - General-purpose "learn to..." tutorials across the intertubes ([google](http://letmegooglethat.com/?q=Python%2C+Ruby%2C+Javascript+programming+beginner+tutorial) is your friend :)  
 - The [Udemy.com Learn Python online video course](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/) - (~15% completed - not abandoned, just backburnered)  
 - Ada Academy's [Prep Material](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/ada-build/tree/master/intro-to-python) - (~35% completed - actively working on)  
 - App Academy's [Intro to Programming (in Ruby)](https://open.appacademy.io/learn/full-stack-online/intro-to-programming/welcome) - (~25% completed - Abandoned for now in favor of Python, what Ada teaches in.)  
  
**This is not the extent of my notes. Sometimes I go handwritten and even do color syntax at times. I have many colorful pens.**
