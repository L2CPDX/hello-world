# Coding Notes

**This repository is a dumping ground for various coding notes I've taken on different beginner / learner tutorials.**  
  
**Notes are from the following:**  
 - General-purpose "learn to..." tutorials across the intertubes (google is your friend :)  
 - The Udemy.com Learn Python online video course ((https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/) - ~15% completed - not abandoned, just backburnered)  
 - Ada Academy's Prep material - ((https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/ada-build/tree/master/intro-to-python) - ~35% completed - actively working on)  
 - App Academy's Intro to Programming in Ruby - ((https://open.appacademy.io/learn/full-stack-online/) - ~25% completed - Abandoned for now in favor of Python, what Ada teaches in.  
  
This is not the extent of my notes. Sometimes I go handwritten and even do color syntax at times. I have many colorful pens.
